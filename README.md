## Getting Set Up
(If you have any of these then skip that step). Depending on your experience with JavaScript and coding in general, this setup process may be intimidating. If you have trouble getting started please let an organizer or someone who has the hang of things know!

### Git
Mac or linux users can skip this step. Windows users should go [here](http://www.git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the download instructions.

### Node
Use the appropriate installer [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).

### NPM
Type this command in the terminal:
```
curl https://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

`npm install` will install all other dependencies.
